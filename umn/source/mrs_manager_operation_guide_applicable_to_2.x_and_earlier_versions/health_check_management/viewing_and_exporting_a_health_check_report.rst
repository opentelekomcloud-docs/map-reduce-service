Viewing and Exporting a Health Check Report
===========================================

Scenario
--------

You can view the health check result in MRS Manager and export the health check results for further analysis.

.. note::

   A system health check includes MRS Manager, service-level, and host-level health checks:

   -  MRS Manager health checks focus on whether the unified management platform can provide management functions.
   -  Service-level health checks focus on whether components can provide services properly.
   -  Host-level health checks focus on whether host indicators are normal.

   The system health check includes three types of check items: health status, related alarms, and customized monitoring indicators for each check object. The health check results are not always the same as the **Health Status** on the portal.

Prerequisites
-------------

You have performed a health check.

Procedure
---------

#. Click **Services**.
#. Choose **More > View Cluster Health Check Report** to view the health check report of a cluster.
#. Click **Export Report** on the health check report pane to export the report and view detailed information about check items.

   .. note::

      For details about how to rectify the faults of the check items, see :ref:`DBService Health Check Indicators <mrs_01_0279>` to :ref:`ZooKeeper Health Check Indicators <mrs_01_0533>`.
