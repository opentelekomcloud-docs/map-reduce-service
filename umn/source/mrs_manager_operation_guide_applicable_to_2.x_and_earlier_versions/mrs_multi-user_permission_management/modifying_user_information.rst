#. On MRS Manager, click **System**.
#. In the **Permission** area, click **Manage User**.
#. In the row of a user to be modified, click **Modify**.

   .. note::

      If you change user groups for a user or assign role permissions to a user, it takes 3 minutes to make new configurations take effect.
