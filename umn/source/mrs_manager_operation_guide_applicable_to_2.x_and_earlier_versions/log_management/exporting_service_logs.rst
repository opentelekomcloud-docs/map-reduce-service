Exporting Service Logs
======================

Scenario
--------

This section describes how to export logs generated by each service role from MRS Manager.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have obtained the access key ID (AK) and secret access key (SK) of the account.
-  A parallel file system has been created in OBS.

Procedure
---------

#. On MRS Manager, click **System**.

#. Click **Export Log** under **Maintenance**.

#. Set a service for **Service**. Set **Host** to the IP address of the host where the service is deployed. Select the corresponding time for **Start Time** and **End Time**.

#. In **Export To**, select a path for saving logs. This parameter is available only for clusters with Kerberos authentication enabled.

   -  **Local PC**: indicates that logs are saved to the local environment. Then go to :ref:`8 <mrs_01_0267__en-us_topic_0035209626_li58318105171043>`.
   -  **OBS**: indicates that logs are saved to OBS. This is the default option. Then go to :ref:`5 <mrs_01_0267__en-us_topic_0035209626_li22688946162748>`.

   Set **OBS Path** to the path for storing service logs on OBS.

   The value must be a complete path and cannot start with a slash (**/**). The path can be nonexistent and will be automatically created by the system. The full path of OBS can contain a maximum of 900 bytes.

#. In **Bucket**, enter the name of the created OBS file system.

#. Set **AK** and **SK** to the access key ID and secret access key of the user.
