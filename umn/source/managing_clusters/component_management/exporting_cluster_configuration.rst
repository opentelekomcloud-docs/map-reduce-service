Exporting Cluster Configuration
===============================

Scenario
--------

You can export all configuration data of a cluster using MRS to meet site requirements. The exported configuration data is used to rapidly update service configuration.

.. note::

   In **MRS 3.x**, you cannot perform operations in this section on the management console.

Prerequisites
-------------

You have synchronized IAM users. (On the **Dashboard** page, click **Synchronize** on the right side of **IAM User Sync** to synchronize IAM users.)

Procedure
---------

On the cluster details page, choose **Configuration** > **Export Cluster Configuration** in the upper right corner.

.. note::

   For versions earlier than MRS 1.7.2, see :ref:`Exporting Configuration Data of a Cluster <mrs_01_0260>`.

The exported file is used to update service configurations. For details, see **Importing Service Configuration Parameters** in :ref:`Configuring Service Parameters <mrs_01_0204>`.
