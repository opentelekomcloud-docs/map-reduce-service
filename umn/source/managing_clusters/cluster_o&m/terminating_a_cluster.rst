Terminating a Cluster
=====================

You can terminate an MRS cluster after job execution is complete.

Background
----------

You can manually terminate a cluster after data analysis is complete or when the cluster encounters an exception. A cluster failed to be deployed will be automatically terminated.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the MRS console.

#. In the navigation tree of the MRS console, choose **Clusters** > **Active Clusters**.

#. Locate the cluster to be terminated, and click **Terminate** in the **Operation** column.

   The cluster status changes from **Running** to **Terminating**, and finally to **Terminated**. You can view the clusters in **Terminated** state in **Cluster History**.
