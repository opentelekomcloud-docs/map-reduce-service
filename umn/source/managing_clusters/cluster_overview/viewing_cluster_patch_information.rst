Viewing Cluster Patch Information
=================================

To view patch information about cluster components, you can download the required patch if the cluster component, such as Hadoop or Spark, is faulty. On the MRS console, choose **Clusters > Active Clusters**, select a cluster, and click the cluster name. On the cluster details page that is displayed, upgrade the component and rectify the fault.

.. note::

   MRS 3.x does not have patch version information. Therefore, this section is not involved.

For clusters of versions earlier than MRS 1.7.0, the patch version information is as follows:

-  Patch Name: name of the patch package
-  Patch Path: location where the patch is stored in OBS
-  Patch Content: patch description

The patch version information for MRS 1.7.0 to 2.x.x is as follows:

-  Patch Name: name of the patch package
-  Published: time when the patch package is released
-  Status: patch status
-  Patch Description: patch version description
-  Operation: patch installation or uninstallation
