#. Click |image1| in the upper-left corner on the management console and select a region and project.

#. In the left navigation pane, choose **Clusters** > **Active Clusters**.

#. Click |image2| or the number on the right of **Failed Tasks**. The **Manage Failed Tasks** page is displayed.

#. In the **Operation** column of the cluster that you want to start, click **Delete**.

   In this step, only one job can be deleted.

#. You can click **Delete All** in the upper left corner of the task list to delete all failed tasks.
