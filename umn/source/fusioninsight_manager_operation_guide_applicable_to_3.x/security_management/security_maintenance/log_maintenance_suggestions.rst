Log Maintenance Suggestions
===========================

Operation logs help discover exceptions such as illegal operations and login by unauthorized users. The system records important operations in logs. You can use operation logs to locate problems.

Checking Logs Regularly
-----------------------

Check system logs periodically and handle exceptions such as unauthorized operations or logins in a timely manner.

Backing Up Logs Regularly
-------------------------

The audit logs provided by FusionInsight Manager and cluster record the user activities and operations. You can export the audit logs on FusionInsight Manager. If there are too many audit logs in the system, you can configure dump parameters to dump audit logs to a specified server to ensure that the cluster nodes disk space is sufficient.
