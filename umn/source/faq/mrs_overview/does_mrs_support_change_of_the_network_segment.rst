Does MRS Support Change of the Network Segment?
===============================================

You can change the network segment. On the cluster **Dashboard** page of MRS console, click **Change Subnet** to the right of **Default Subnet**, and select a subnet in the VPC of the cluster to expand subnet IP addresses. Selecting a new subnet will not change the IP addresses and subnets of existing nodes.
