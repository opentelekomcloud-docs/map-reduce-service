What Is the Compression Ratio of zstd?
======================================

Zstandard (zstd) is an open-source fast lossless compression algorithm. The compression ratio of zstd is twice that of orc. For details, see https://github.com/L-Angel/compress-demo. CarbonData does not support lzo, and MRS has zstd integrated.
