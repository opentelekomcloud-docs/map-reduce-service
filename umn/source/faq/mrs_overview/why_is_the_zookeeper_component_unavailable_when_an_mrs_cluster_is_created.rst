Why Is the ZooKeeper Component Unavailable When an MRS Cluster Is Created?
==========================================================================

If you create a cluster of a version earlier than MRS 3.\ *x*, ZooKeeper is installed by default and is not displayed on the GUI.

If you create a cluster of MRS 3.\ *x* or later, ZooKeeper is available on the GUI and is selected by default.

After the cluster is created, the ZooKeeper component is available on the **Components** page.
