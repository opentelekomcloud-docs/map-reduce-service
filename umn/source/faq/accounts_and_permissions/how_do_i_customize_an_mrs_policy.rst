How Do I Customize an MRS Policy?
=================================

#. On the IAM console, choose **Permissions** in the navigation pane, and click **Create Custom Policy**.

#. Set a policy name in **Policy Name**.

#. Set **Scope** to **Project-level service** for MRS.

#. Specify **Policy View**. The following options are supported:

   -  **Visual editor**: Select cloud services, actions, resources, and request conditions from the navigation pane to customize the policy. You do not require knowledge of JSON syntax.
   -  **JSON**: Edit JSON policies from scratch or based on an existing policy.

   You can also click **Select Existing Policy/Role** in the **Policy Content** area to select an existing policy as the template for modification.

#. (Optional) Enter a brief description in the **Description** area.

#. Click **OK**.

#. Attach the policy to a user group. Users in the group then inherit the permissions defined in this policy.
