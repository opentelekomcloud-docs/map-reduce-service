What Is the Port for Accessing HDFS Using Python?
=================================================

The default port of open source HDFS is **50070** for versions earlier than MRS 3.0.0, and **9870** for MRS 3.0.0 or later. :ref:`Common HDFS Ports <mrs_03_1060__section588612577293>` describes the common ports of HDFS.
