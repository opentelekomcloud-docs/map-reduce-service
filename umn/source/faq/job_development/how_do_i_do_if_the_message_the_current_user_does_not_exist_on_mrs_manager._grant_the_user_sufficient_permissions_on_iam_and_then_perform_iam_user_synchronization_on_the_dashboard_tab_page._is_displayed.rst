How Do I Do If the Message "The current user does not exist on MRS Manager. Grant the user sufficient permissions on IAM and then perform IAM user synchronization on the Dashboard tab page." Is Displayed?
============================================================================================================================================================================================================

If IAM synchronization is not performed when a job is submitted in a security cluster, the error message "The current user does not exist on MRS Manager. Grant the user sufficient permissions on IAM and then perform IAM user synchronization on the Dashboard tab page." is displayed.

Before submitting a job, on the **Dashboard** page, click **Synchronize** on the right side of **IAM User Sync** to synchronize IAM users.
