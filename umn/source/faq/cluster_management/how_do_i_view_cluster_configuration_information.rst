How Do I View Cluster Configuration Information?
================================================

-  After a cluster is created, click the cluster name on the MRS console. On the page displayed, you can view basic configuration information about the cluster. The instance specifications and node capacity determine the data analysis and processing capability. Higher instance specifications and larger capacity enable faster data processing at a higher cost.
-  On the basic information page, click **Access Manager** to access the MRS cluster management page. On MRS Manager, you can view and handle alarms, and modify cluster configuration.
