How Do I View All Clusters?
===========================

You can view all MRS clusters on the **Clusters** page. You can view clusters in different status.

-  **Active Clusters**: all clusters except clusters in **Failed** and **Terminated** states.
-  **Cluster History**: clusters in the **Terminated** state. Only the clusters terminated within the last six months are displayed. If you want to view clusters terminated more than six months ago, contact technical support engineers.
-  **Failed Tasks**: tasks in **Failed** state. The failed tasks include the following:

   -  Tasks failed to create clusters
   -  Tasks failed to terminate clusters
   -  Tasks failed to scale out clusters
   -  Tasks failed to scale in clusters
