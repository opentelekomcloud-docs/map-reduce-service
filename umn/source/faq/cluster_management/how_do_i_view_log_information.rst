How Do I View Log Information?
==============================

You can view operation logs of clusters and jobs on the **Operation Logs** page. The MRS operation logs record the following operations:

-  Cluster operations

   -  Create, terminate, and scale out or in clusters
   -  Create directories and delete directories or files

-  Job operations: Create, stop, and delete jobs
-  Data operations: IAM user tasks, add users, and add user groups
