Can I Expand Data Disk Capacity for MRS?
========================================

You can expand data disk capacity for MRS during off-peak hours.

Expand the EVS disk capacity, and then log in to the ECS and expand the partitions and file system. MRS nodes are installed using public images and support the capacity expansion of in-use EVS disks.
