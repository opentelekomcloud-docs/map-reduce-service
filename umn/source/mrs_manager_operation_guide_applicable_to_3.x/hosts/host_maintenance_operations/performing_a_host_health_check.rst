Performing a Host Health Check
==============================

Scenario
--------

If the running status of a host is not **Normal**, you can perform health checks on the host to check whether some basic functions are abnormal. During routine O&M, you can perform host health checks to ensure that the configuration parameters and monitoring of each role instance on the host are normal and can run stably for a long time.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to MRS Manager.

#. Click **Hosts**.

#. Select the check box of the target host.

#. Select **Health Check** from the **More** drop-down list to start the health check.

   To export the result of the health check, click **Export Report** in the upper left corner. If any problem is detected, click **Help**.
