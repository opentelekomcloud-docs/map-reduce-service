Creating a User
===============

Scenario
--------

MRS Manager supports a maximum of 50,000 users (including built-in users). By default, only user **admin** has the highest operation permissions of MRS Manager. You need to create users on MRS Manager and assign operation permissions to the users based on service requirements.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to MRS Manager.

#. Choose **System** > **Permission** > **User**.

#. On the **User** page, click **Create**.

#. Set **Username**. The username can contain digits, letters, underscores (_), hyphens (-), and spaces. It is case-insensitive and cannot be the same as any existing username in the system or OS.

#. Set **User Type** to **Human-Machine** or **Machine-Machine**.

   -  **Human-Machine** user: used for MRS Manager O&M and component client operations. If you select this option, you also need to select the password policy and set **Password** and **Confirm Password**.
   -  **Machine-Machine** user: used for component application development. If you select this option, the password is randomly generated.

#. In the **User Group** area, click **Add** to add one or more user groups to the list.

   .. note::

      -  If the selected user group has been bound to a role or a permission policy has been configured in Ranger, the user can obtain the corresponding permissions.
      -  After MRS Manager is installed, some user groups generated by default have special permissions. Select desired user groups based on the descriptions on the UI.
      -  If existing user groups cannot meet your requirements, click **Create User Group** to create a user group. For details, see :ref:`Creating a User Group <admin_guide_000147__section205453863818>`.

#. Select a group from the **Primary Group** drop-down list to create directories and files.

   The drop-down list contains all groups selected in **User Group**.

   .. note::

      A user can belong to multiple groups (including the primary group and secondary groups). The primary group is set to facilitate maintenance and comply with the permission mechanism of the Hadoop community. The primary group has the same permission control functionality as other groups.

#. In the **Role** area, click **Add** to bind roles to the user.

   .. note::

      -  Adding a role when you create a user can specify the user permissions.

      -  If the permissions granted to the user from the user group cannot meet service requirements, you can bind other created roles to the user. You can also click **Create Role** to create a role first. For details, see :ref:`Creating a Role <admin_guide_000148__section2095713912713>`.

         It takes 3 minutes to make role permission assignment to the user take effect. If the permissions obtained from the user group are enough, you do not need to add a role.

      -  After Ranger authentication is enabled for a component, you need to configure Ranger policies to assign permissions to the user except the permissions of default user group or role.

      -  If a user is not added to a user group or assigned a role, the user cannot view information or perform operations after logging in to MRS Manager.

#. Enter information in **Description**.

#. Click **OK**.

   After a human-machine user is created, you need to change the initial password as prompted after logging in to MRS Manager.
