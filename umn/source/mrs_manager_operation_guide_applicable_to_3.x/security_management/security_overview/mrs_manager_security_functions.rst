MRS Manager Security Functions
==============================

You can query and set user rights data through the following MRS Manager modules:

-  User management: Users can be added, deleted, modified, queried, bound to user groups, and assigned with roles.

   For details, see :ref:`Managing Users <admin_guide_000136>`.

-  User group management: User groups can be added, deleted, modified, queried, and bound to roles.

   For details, see :ref:`Managing User Groups <admin_guide_000147>`.

-  Role management: Roles can be added, deleted, modified, queried, and assigned with the resource access rights of one or multiple components.

   For details, see :ref:`Managing Roles <admin_guide_000148>`.

-  Tenant management: Tenants can be added, deleted, modified, queried, and bound to component resources. MRS generates a role for each tenant to facilitate management. If a tenant is assigned with the rights of some resources, its corresponding role also has these rights.

   For details, see :ref:`Tenant Resources <admin_guide_000087>`.
