Account Maintenance Suggestions
===============================

It is recommended that the administrator conduct routine checks on the accounts. The check covers the following items:

-  Check whether the accounts of the OS, MRS Manager, and each component are necessary and whether temporary accounts have been deleted.
-  Check whether the permissions of the accounts are appropriate. Different administrators have different rights.
-  Check and audit the logins and operation records of all types of accounts.
