Job Management
==============

The job management function provides an entry for you to submit jobs in a cluster, including MapReduce, Spark, HiveQL, and SparkSQL jobs. MRS works with Data Lake Governance Center (DGC) to provide a one-stop big data collaboration development environment and fully-managed big data scheduling capabilities, helping you effortlessly build big data processing centers.

DGC allows you to develop and debug MRS HiveQL/SparkSQL scripts online and develop MRS jobs by performing drag-and-drop operations to migrate and integrate data between MRS and over 20 heterogeneous data sources. Powerful job scheduling and flexible monitoring and alarming help you easily manage data and job O&M.
