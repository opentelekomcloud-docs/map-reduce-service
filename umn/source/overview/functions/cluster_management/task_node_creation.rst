Task Node Creation
==================

Feature Introduction
--------------------

Task nodes can be created and used for computing only. They do not store persistent data and are the basis for implementing auto scaling.

Customer Benefits
-----------------

When MRS is used only as a computing resource, Task nodes can be used to reduce costs and facilitate cluster node scaling, flexibly meeting users' requirements for increasing or decreasing cluster computing capabilities.

Application Scenarios
---------------------

When the data volume change is small in a cluster but the cluster's service processing capabilities need to be remarkably and temporarily improved, add Task nodes to address the following situations:

-  The number of temporary services is increased, for example, report processing at the end of the year.
-  Long-term tasks need to be completed in a short time, for example, some urgent analysis tasks.
