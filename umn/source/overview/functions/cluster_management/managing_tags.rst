Managing Tags
=============

Tags are cluster identifiers. Adding tags to clusters can help you identify and manage your cluster resources. By associating with Tag Management Service (TMS), MRS allows users with a large number of cloud resources to tag cloud resources, quickly search for cloud resources with the same tag attribute, and perform unified management operations such as review, modification, and deletion, facilitating unified management of big data clusters and other cloud resources.

You can add a maximum of 10 tags to a cluster when creating the cluster or add them on the details page of the created cluster.
