Selecting an API Type
=====================

Currently, MRS provides two types (V1 and V2) of APIs for cloud services with customized specifications. Only part of V2 APIs is available and mainly used for submitting jobs and SQL statements. If the API functions are the same, you are advised to use the V2 APIs first.

All MRS versions support the V1 APIs. MRS 1.9.2 or later supports the V2 APIs.

Based on the V1 APIs, the V2 APIs have the following enhancements:

-  Jobs can be submitted in a security cluster.
-  The HiveSQL, Spark Python, and Flink jobs are supported.
-  The SparkSQL and SparkScript results can be queried.

For details about the APIs and their functions, see :ref:`API Overview <mrs_02_0007>`.
