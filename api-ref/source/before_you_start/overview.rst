Overview
========

Welcome to *MapReduce Service API Reference*. MapReduce Service (MRS) provides enterprise-level big data clusters on the cloud. Tenants can fully control the clusters and easily run big data components such as Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Kafka, and Storm in the clusters.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on MRS, such as creating or deleting clusters, adjusting nodes, as well as creating and executing jobs. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <mrs_02_0007>`.

If you plan to access MRS through an API, ensure that you are familiar with MRS concepts. For details, see **Service Overview** in the *MapReduce Service User Guide*.
