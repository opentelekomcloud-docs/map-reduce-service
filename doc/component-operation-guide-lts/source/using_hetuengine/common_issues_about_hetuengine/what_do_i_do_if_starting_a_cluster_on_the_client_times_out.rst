What Do I Do If Starting a Cluster on the Client Times Out?
===========================================================

Question
--------

If the cluster startup on the client takes a long time, the waiting times out and the waiting page exits.

Answer
------

If the cluster startup times out, the waiting page automatically exits. You can log in to the cluster again until the cluster is successfully started. Additionally, you can also view the cluster running status on the HSConsole page. When the cluster is in the running state, log in to the cluster again. If the cluster fails to be started, you can locate the fault based on the startup logs. For details, see :ref:`Log Description <mrs_01_1744>`.
