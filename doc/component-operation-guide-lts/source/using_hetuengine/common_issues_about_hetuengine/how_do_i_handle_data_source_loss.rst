How Do I Handle Data Source Loss?
=================================

Question
--------

Why is the data source lost when I log in to the client to check the data source connected to the HSConsole page?

Answer
------

The possible cause of data source loss is that the DBService active/standby switchover occurs or the database connection usage exceeds the threshold. You can log in to FusionInsight Manager to view the alarm information and clear the DBService alarm based on the alarm guide.
