Hue Page Cannot Be Displayed When the Hive Service Is Not Installed in a Cluster
================================================================================

Question
--------

If the Hive service is not installed in the cluster, the native Hue service page is blank.

Answer
------

In the current version, Hue depends on the Hive component. If this occurs, check whether the Hive component is installed in the current cluster. If not, install the Hive component.
