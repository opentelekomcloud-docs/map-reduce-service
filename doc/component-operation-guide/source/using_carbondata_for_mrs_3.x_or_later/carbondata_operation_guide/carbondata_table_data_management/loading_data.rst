Loading Data
============

Scenario
--------

After a CarbonData table is created, you can run the **LOAD DATA** command to load data to the table for query. Once data loading is triggered, data is encoded in CarbonData format and files in multi-dimensional and column-based format are compressed and copied to the HDFS path of CarbonData files for quick analysis and queries. The HDFS path can be configured in the **carbon.properties** file. For details, see :ref:`Configuration Reference <mrs_01_1404>`.
