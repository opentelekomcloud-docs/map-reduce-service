Viewing Flume Client Monitoring Information
===========================================

Scenario
--------

The Flume client outside the FusionInsight cluster is a part of the end-to-end data collection. Both the Flume client outside the cluster and the Flume server in the cluster need to be monitored. Users can use FusionInsight Manager to monitor the Flume client and view the monitoring indicators of the Source, Sink, and Channel of the client as well as the client process status.

This section applies to MRS 3.\ *x* or later clusters.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to FusionInsight Manager.
#. Choose **Cluster** > *Name of the desired cluster* > **Services** > **Flume** > **Flume Management** to view the current Flume client list and process status.
#. Click the **Instance ID**, and view client monitoring metrics in the **Current** area.
#. Click **History**. The page for querying historical monitoring data is displayed. Select a time range and click **View** to view the monitoring data within the time range.
