Why Is the Hue Native Page Cannot Be Properly Displayed If the Hive Service Is Not Installed in a Cluster?
==========================================================================================================

Question
--------

Why is the native Hue page blank if the Hive service is not installed in a cluster?

Answer
------

In MRS 3.x, Hue depends on Hive. If this problem occurs, check whether the Hive component is installed in the current cluster. If not, install it.
