How Do I Solve the Problem that HQL Fails to Be Executed in Hue Using Internet Explorer?
========================================================================================

Question
--------

What do I do if all HQL statements fail to be executed when I use Internet Explorer to access Hive Editor in Hue and the message "There was an error with your query" is displayed?

Answer

Internet Explorer does not support processing of AJAX POST requests containing form data in 307 redirection. You are advised to use a compatible browser, for example, Google Chrome.
